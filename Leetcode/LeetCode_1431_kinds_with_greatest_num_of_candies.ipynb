    "### 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the array `candies` and the integer `extraCandies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies that the ith kid has.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each kid check if there is a way to distribute `extraCandies` among the kids such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the **greatest** number of candies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3\n",
    "Output: [true,true,true,false,true] \n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. \n",
    "Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. \n",
    "Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. \n",
    "Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. \n",
    "Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. "
