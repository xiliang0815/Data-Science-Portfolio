# Predicting Commuting Choice In Australia

The purpose of this project is to perform simple EDA on the dataset published by Sydney Transportation Study, and use logistic regression to predict consumer's commuting choice to get to work, based on four features, "cartime", "carcost", "traintime", and "traincost". Prior predicting commuting choice, I will run a decision tree in order to gain better insight what are the consumers' decisions based upon.
